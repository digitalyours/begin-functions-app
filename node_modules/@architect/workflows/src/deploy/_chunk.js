/**
 * 8 is a magic number;
 *
 * Things we know:
 *
 * - AWS has a Transactions Per Second metric
 * - UpdateFunctionCode has a hard limit TPS of 15: so we know we have an upperbound max chunk speed of 15 updates per second
 * - yazl failed w a default len of 10 on Linux; perhaps we should drop to os level `cp` on *nix systems in a child process?
 * - Saw npm installation errors (without reporting an error) with a default len of 12
 *
 * everything seems fine w 8; yes thats spooky and we should investigate further! we tuned PARALLEL_DEPLOYS_PER_SECOND on our CI to 5 for now
